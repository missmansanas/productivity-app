        Hey there! Welcome to my web app, built with love and coding wizardry! ðŸ˜„âœ¨ I'm Apple, a junior web developer from Manila.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm building my portfolio, and each simple web app I create is both a lesson and a labor of love! I deeply enjoy experimenting with new technologies and frameworks to bring fun and meaningful online experiences. As a multi-passionate creator, I pour my heart and soul into crafting each web app, infusing it with creativity and problem-solving skills that I've honed along the way. ðŸŒŸ
      </p>
      <p>
        Join me on this exciting journey as I grow and learn. Your support means the world to me, and I'm excited to always create something new and meaningful. ðŸŒˆðŸ™Œ
